## About DocMaglana

A Project for recording details to be used by a physician. Making records easy to navigate and track patient data.

## Back-end: Laravel Sanctum

I think this is a good choice for handling small to medium projects.

## Front-end: Vue JS with Quasar Framework

Quasar framework is used with vue in order to make the project PWA. Easier exporting into application with only one code base.

## Developers

<ul>
    <li>Oliver Maglana</li>
